# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Python

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple Handwritten Digit Recognition system using Python. It uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), to train a machine learning model to predict the digit represented in an image.

## Introduction

Handwritten digit recognition is a widely studied problem in computer vision and pattern recognition. This project demonstrates a simple implementation using machine learning and deep learning models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Dataset

The project uses the MNIST dataset:
- **Training Set**: 60,000 images of digits.
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images of digits.
